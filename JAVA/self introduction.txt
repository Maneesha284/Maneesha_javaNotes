The Hospital Information System (HIS) is a web-native, integrated, multi-facility, multi-lingual, and scalable platform 
tailored to fulfill the comprehensive information and communication requirements of administrative, operational, revenue, 
and clinical departments within medium to very large hospitals and healthcare networks. It encompasses diverse modules 
including Front Desk, ADT, Doctor Workbench, Nursing Station, Pharmacy, Inventory, Billing Laboratory, and Specialty. 
Functionality includes real-time monitoring of patient status, financial transactions tracking, visit history management, 
and comprehensive test records. Recently, a Patient Portal website was introduced to facilitate appointment booking via 
WhatsApp (WATI).

Objective:
This project is aimed at developing a ship management system which can streamline the administration of a ship based transport company. It’s often 
felt that the ship management is a difficult task. It involves many administrative work and co-ordination. This project is to develop and deploy a web based 
application so that the different aspects of a ship based transport company administration become easy to handle.
Existing System:
•	This existing system is not providing secure registration and profile management of all the users properly.

Proposed System:
The development of this new system contains more activities, which try to automate the entire process keeping in the view of database integration approach.
•	This system maintains user’s personal, address, and contact details.
•	User friendliness is provided in the application with various controls provided by system rich user interface.
•	This system makes the overall project management much easier and flexible.
•	Various classes have been used for maintain the details of all the users   and catalog. 
•	Authentication is provided for this application only registered users can access.
•	The user’s information files can be stored in Centralized database which can be maintained by the system.
•	This system is providing more memory for the users to maintain data. 
•	This system is providing accessibility control to data with respect to users.
•	This system is providing online facilities to book both cargo ships and passenger ships for voyages.
•	This is providing facilities to store different type of administrative data through online like ship details, ship parts stock, employee details, 
ship reservation details, purchase  details and different pay bill details e t c.
•	This system also providing facilities to access the above data to generate requirement specific report.

1.	Authentication and Security Module
2.	Admin Module
3.	Employee Module.
4.	User Module.
5.	Ship Module.
6.	Account Module.
7.	Reports Module.

2.	Admin Module
This module consists of the following sub modules: 
a.	Registration Module
Here mail admin register new employees and store their details in database. Not only Employees , by the help of other modules but also registers new ships an
d their new equipment purchase.
b.	Users Management Module
•	Here an admin can access any user related information, for example their hierarchy ,contact details, login details…etc. And also can update their data 
as per requests.
•	He can also assign task to employees and can view the status of the task.
c.	Payment Management Module
In this module admin manages different payments made by him. He pays salary to employee, pay bills to the equipment purchase, pay bills to ship maintains cost.

I have worked as a key member on offloading management and faced more complications and overgain these complications.

3.2	PROPOSED SYSTEM
     In this proposed system, MEC system with multiple SBSs serving multiple users equipments. The energy-efficient computation offloading management is
 used to reduce the energy consumption of all user equipments. The energy efficient computation management scheme by optimizing the offloading decision 
making, channel allocation, computation resource allocation scheme, while taking into account the interference management and power control scheme. 
An efficient computation offloading scheme is needed. These need a deep study on the problem in the deployed small cell networks (SCN). The computation 
offloading system model in a densely deployed distributed SCN with MEC, where the macro base station (MBS) and the SBSs are all equipped with MEC 
server. The computation offloading model and formulate this problem as a mix integer non-linear programming problem, which is NP-hard. The advantages
 of genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), this design a suboptimal algorithm named as hierarchical genetic algorithm and particle
 swarm optimization-based computation algorithm to solve this problem. The Computation offloading mainly three phases. They are uploading data through 
the wireless channels, executing the task on the MEC servers and downloading results from the MEC server to the user equipments .Specially, the user 
equipments need not only to decide whether to offload but also to determine where to offload in the offloading decision making.
Advantages:
This system solves the mix integer non-linear programming.
MEC servers are used to the reducing energy consumption.
This system obtains the benefit of efficiency, which is significant.

3.4 Functional Requirements
The energy computation management scheme should be needed for optimizing the offloading decision making.
The channel allocation should be needed.
The computation resource allocation should be done.
The interference management and power control schemes should be implemented.
