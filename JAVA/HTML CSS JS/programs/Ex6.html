<h1> <u> A Brief History of the Web </u> </h1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Web was born in a particle physics laboratory (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland in <i>1989</i>. There a computer specialist named <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> first proposed a system of information management that used a “hypertext” process to link related documents over a network. He and his partner, <b>Robert Cailliau</b>, created a prototype and released it for review. For the first several years, web pages were text-only. It’s difficult to believe that in <i>1992</i>, the world had only about <i>50</i> web servers.
