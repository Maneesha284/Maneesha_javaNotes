	The Web was born in a particle physics laboratory (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland in <i>1989</i>. 
	There a computer specialist named <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> first proposed a system of information management that used a “hypertext” 
process to link related documents over a network. 
	He and his partner, <b>Robert Cailliau</b>, created a prototype and released it for review. 



	For the first several years, web pages were text-only. It’s difficult to believe that 
in <i>1992</i>, the world had only about <i>50</i> web servers.
