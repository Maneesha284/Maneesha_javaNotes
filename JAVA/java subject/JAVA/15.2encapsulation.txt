Encapsulation:-
===========
The process of grouping Data members and corresponding methods into single unit.
"hiding data behand methods"
encapsulation=data hiding+abstraction

Data hiding:-
========
Hiding of data. Our internal data should not go out directly
out side person should not access internal data directly we have hide data.
Advantage:-
Data hiding is security.
class Account
{
    private double balance;
      {
            public double getBalance();
            {
                if valid
                     return balance;
               else
                  no return;
             }
        }
}
Advantage:-
=======
1)Security
2)Enhancement(if we can any changes with out effecting end user)
3)Maintainbility of the application
Disadvantage:-
==========
Every data member we requier provide setter and getter
Every time validation must be require. increases length of the code slows down execution

class student
{
   String name;
   int rollno;
      // +
   read(){}  
   write(){}
}


class Account
{
    private double balance;
     public double getBalance()
     {
         if valid
        return balance;
      }
      public void setBalance(double amount)
     {
        //validation
        this.balance=this.balance+amount;
    }
}

Tightly Encapsulated Class:-
===================
Iff "Every variable present inside that class is private". such type that class Tightly Encapsulated Class

public class Account
{
    private double balance;      //Tightly Encapsulated Class
        
     public double getBalance()
     {
         if valid
        return balance;
      }
}

class A
{
    private int x=10;            //Tightly Encapsulated Class
}

class B extends A
{
    int y=20;                         //Not Tightly Encapsulated Class
}

class C extends A
{
    private int z=30;               //Tightly Encapsulated Class
}

class A
{
    int x=10;            //not Tightly Encapsulated Class
}
class B extends A
{
    private int y=20;            //not Tightly Encapsulated Class
}
class C extends A
{
    private int z=30;               //not Tightly Encapsulated Class
}
