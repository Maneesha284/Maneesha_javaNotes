MongoDB

Extermely large: huge a Humongous building humongous amounts of data
Vendor: MongoDB
https://www.mongodb.com/
Atals: fully manages colud DB

where we can use MongoDB:
we can use anywhere (desktop app, mobile app, web app,..)
stack: to develop app muliple technologies required

The most popular stacks:
MEAN stack 
MERN stack  
[ frontend framework(Angular,React),[backend framework(Express), server side runtime env(Node.js)], DB(MongoDB) ]
M - MongoDB
E - Express
A - Angular JS
R - React JS
N - Node js

By using MEAN and MERN stacks we can build JS based web application
Angular JS React JS Node js is based on java script  
Advantage: MongoDB is also based on java script, No Schema High performance (Fast retrving data)
MongoDB internally used Mozilla's Spider monkey java script engine

what is the type of  MongoDB?
we have 2 types DB's(Relation DB/SQL DB, Documnet DB/NoSQL DB)

Relation DB/SQL DB:
Fixed scheme(Employee(eno,ename,...)
Data will be stored in tables has realtionships(1-M,M-M,M-1) 
joins required for fetching data from muliple tables
ex: oracle,MySQL

Documnet DB/NoSQL DB:
Data will be stored in sperate documents, Each document independent of others 
there is no Fixed scheme
Database-->(Collections-->(Documents-->(Record)))
DB contains multiple Collections 
Each Collection contains documents
Each document contains record 

MongoDB Structure:
MongoDB physical contain serveral logical Data bases
MongoDB(DB1,DB2,DB3...)
Each DB contains serveral multiple Collections)
Collection is something like table in relatinal database.
Each Collection contains serveral documents
Document is something like record/row in relatinal database.
Each document 

How data represented in MongoDB?
in JSON format (it is a key/value pair)
JSON: java script object notation
BSON: Binary JSON

Example:
Database: shopping card database
Collections: customer, products, orders
Customer Collection: contains serveral documents
document 1: 
	{
		"name":"abc",
		"age":20,
		"salary":2000
	}
document 2: 
	{
		"name":"pqr"
	}
document 3: 
	{
		"name":"xyz",
		"age":20,
		"address":
			{
				"city":"hyd"
			}
		"hobbies":[
					{
						"name":"cricket",
					},
					{
						"name":"swiming",
					}
				  ]
				  
	}

Database Engine: JSON convert to BSON and BSON convert to JSON

key characterstics of MongoDB :
1.All information related to a document will be stored in a single place.
2.To retrive data, it is not required to perform join operations and hence retrieval is very fast.
3. Documents are independent of each other and and no schema. hence we can store unstructured data like 
videos audio files etc.
4.we can perform operations like update existing document, delete document, insert new document versy easily
5.Retrive data in the form of JSON which can be understandable by any programming language without any conversion
6.we can store very huge amount of data and hence scalability is more.


Install MonogoDB:
=================
MongoDB shell and MongoDB server
---------------------------------
Java script based application. 
MongoDB server is responsible to store our data in DB
MongoDB shell is responsible to Manage server
by using this shell we can perform all required CURD operations
MongoDB server can be either local or remote

To start MongoDB sever -> "mongod" command
To start MongoDB shell -> "mongo" command

GUI support is also there there for MongoDB shell
1.Compass
2.Robo T3
etc...

MongoDB Driver:
---------------
monogodb.com-->docs-->drivers
From application if we want to communicate with DB, driver software required 

It's free(community version) and paid(commercial Enterpise version)
Diff b/w Enterprice and community versions ? 
extra features in Enterprice version

Install MonogoDB as a service If u start our system automatically service will be start 
otherwise Need to start
