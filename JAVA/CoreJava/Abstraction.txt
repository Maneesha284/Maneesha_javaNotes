Abstraction is the process of seperating ideas from the implementation.
Idea we can define idea in one class and implemntation will be defined in another class.
Abstraction can be implemented by using Abstract class and interfaces.

*Esentail details and functionality will show to user, but non esential implementation details can't show to user.

Abstract method:-
================
*A method without implemntation is called abstract method.


*Abstract methods must be overriden in the sub classes. 

*In case of concrete method that is our wish to overriden or not.

Abstract class:-
================
*If a class contains atleast one abstract method that class will be called as abstract class.

*A abstract class contains concrete methods as well as abstract methods.


*we can not create object for abstract class. only we can create reference variable. That reference variable can refer any 
subclass object.

*static method doesn't create in abstract class. 

*When you call a method of the subclass by using super class reference variable the binding is happening at runtime . 
Therefore this process is called Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic dispatcher.
