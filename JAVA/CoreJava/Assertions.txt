=================

*Assertions are used for "testing purpose during development" to ensure thar specified condition is true.

*An "assert" stmt contains a boolean expression that the programmer belives to be true at the time the statement is executed.


syntax:-
assert expression;
assert expression1 : expression2;


class Test {
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int value = 15;
        assert value >= 20 : " Underweight";
        System.out.println("value is " + value);
    }
}
