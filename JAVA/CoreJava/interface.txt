Interface:-
===========
1.It is a kind of class.
2.It is specification from which you can create a class.
3.Bydefault all variables in the interface is public static final variables.
4.Bydefault all methods are the interface is public abstract methods
5. implements keyword.

interface <interface_name> {
	public static datatype variable_name;
	public abstract datatype method_name(---);
} 

6.We can acheive multiple inheritance using interface.
7.We can't creta object to the interface. but we can create reference variable.
8.In case of abstract methods we must override in the subclass.

class-----extends-------class
abstract class-----extends-------class
abstract class-----extends-------abstract class
interface------implements-------class
interface-----extends-------interface
