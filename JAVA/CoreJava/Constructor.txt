class is a 2 types :-
1.Library class
main method not present
methods: functionalties
2.Application class
Main is present
method.

Constructor:-
----------------
*class name and cons name both are same there is no return type.
*It is used to initailize an object or instance variable of the class
*When we create an object of the class default constructor gets executed.
*Constructor will be invoked implicitly where as methods will be invoked explicitly.
*We can create 2 types of cons
Defult cons
Parameterized cons
*Constructor will be executed on an object only one time where as methods will be executed multiple times

Constructor Overloading:-
-------------------------
Same constructor name with diff parameters multiple times they behave loaded to perform diff tasks is called Constructor
Overloading.

We can call one cons from other cons with in the same class using this()
It should be the first statement inside the cons.

this():-this() is used to call one cons from another cons within the same class.

Access Specifiers:
==================
Access Specifiers specifies who can access them.
There are four access specifiers used in java
public
private
protected 
default

1.Class level access specifiers--->for java classes only
two access specifiers are allowed
public-->can be accessed from anywhere
default--->can be accessed from specific

2.Memberlevel access specifiers
all four access specifiers are allowed
public->can be accessed from anywhere
private->can be accessed with in the class
protected->can be accessed from same package and a subclass existing in any package.
default->can be accessed with in same package
