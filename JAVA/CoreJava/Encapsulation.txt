Encapsulation:-
===============
Encapsulation is a process wraping of code and data togather into a single unit.
Encapsulation is technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the 
fields via public methods.
If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, there by 
hiding the fields within the class.
Encapsulation is also data hiding

*Ability to modify our implemented code without breaking the code of others who use our code.
*Helps in protecting against accidental or wrong usage.
*Gives maintainbility, flexibility and extensibilty to our code.

1.Declare class as public 
2.Declare all attributes as private.
3.Every attribute we have define one pair of setter and getter methods
4.Setter method is used to initailize instance variables of the class
5.Getter method is used to access the value of the variable.
6.we can override methods which are present in object.
equals(), toString(), hashCode()

*toString() converts object to string.

public class Employee1 {
	private int empNo;
	private String ename;
	public int getEmpNo() {
		return empNo;
	}
	public void setEmpNo(int empNo) {
		this.empNo = empNo;
	}
	public String getEname() {
		return ename;
	}
	public void setEname(String ename) {
		this.ename = ename;
	}
}
