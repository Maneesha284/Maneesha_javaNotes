Introduction to Advanced JAVA
 ======================
*We can develope Stand Alone APP by using Core Java knowlegde. Which are running on single mechine
Stand alone app 2 types

1.GUI based application
Eg:-calculator, video games, Ms word, paint---->Desktop App

2.CUI based application
Eg:-Command prompt(cmd>java Test)----->Console App

3.Web Application
We want to develop Web Application. 
The app which can  provide services over the web is called Web Application. In java can able to develop we app by using JDBC, Servlets, JSP
Eg:-gmail.com, facebook.com etc..
                                                          Process servlet
Login page(login.jsp)------------->validating data-------------------------------------->DB
details page
results page                                      read data                                                               Invalid page(valid)(inbox.jsp)
                                                         compare with db values                                      Error page(in valid)(error.jsp)
                                                         read mails from db

JSP:-
To develop View Component of JSP(presentation logic to display somthing for end user)
Servlet:-
It is processing our request. The component which is working internally to process our request/logic this component called servlet. servlet ment for processing logic
(Where ever processing/business logic is required then go for servlet)
JDBC:-
Some times java component required to communicate with db
(Java<---->db) Then we should go for JDBC

1.Java Standard Edition (J2SE / JSE)---------->core java+JDBC
2.Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE / JEE)-------->Servlets+JSPs
3.Java Micro Edition (J2ME / JME)------------>To develop mobile/embeded app

JDBC---->4.2V
Servlets--->3.1V
JSPs------->2.3V
