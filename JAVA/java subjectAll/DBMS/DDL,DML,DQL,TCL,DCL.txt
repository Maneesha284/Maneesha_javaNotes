 1. Data Defination Language:-
=====================
create:-It is used to create Databse objects like tables, views, indexes, synonyms
SQL>create table std(sno number(10),sname varchar2(20),phno number(4));
Table created.
TRUNCATE to delete data from the table.
SQL>truncate table emp2;

DROP to drop a table.
SQL>drop table student;

RENAME to rename a table.
SQL>rename emp3 to yadav;

2.DML:-
INSERT:– insert data into a table.
>insert into std values(101,'anu',5367);

>insert into std values(&sno,'&sname',&phno);

UPDATE – updates existing data within a table.
>update std set sname='uma' where sno=101;

DELETE – deletes all records from a table, the space for the records remain.
>delete std where eno=103; (1 row deleted)
>delete std; (all rows deleted)

MERGE – UPSERT operation (insert or update)

DQL :-
SELECT – retrieve data from the a database.
>select * from emp;

TCL:-
Commit:- commit a Transacion.
Rollback:- rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.
Save point:- Sets a savepoint with in a transaction.

DCL:-
Grant and Revoke which mainly deals with the rights,
permissions and other controls of database system
Data contol language
Grant:-Gives users access privileges to database
Revoke:-Withdraw users access privilleges given by using the grant command.

alter:-
(alter add,alter modify, alter drop)

alter add:-add columns into the existing table
SQL>alter table std add(percentage number(2));
alter modify:change column datatype or change datatype size
SQL>alter table std modify(phno number(5));

SQL>alter table std modify(percentage varchar2(2));

alter drop:remove the column from table.
droping columns  oracle provided following 2 commands

method1:-To remove single column
SQL>alter table std drop column percentage;

method2:-To remove single or multiple columns
SQL> alter table std drop(sname,phno);

drop:-
=====
It is used to remove database  objects from database.
SQL>drop table tablename;
SQL>drop index indexname;
*It is used to drop cmd oracle 2.0 to oracle 9i perminently removed from database
*It is used to drop cmd oracle 10g, 11g, 12c(EE) to store in recycle bin.
*Get if back table from recycle bin
SQL>flashback table <tablename> to before drop;
*To drop table perminently
SQL>drop table <tablename> purge;

rename:-It is used to renamining table name
sql>rename std to student;

column rename:-
sql>alter table student rename column  sno to snumber;

truncate:-This command is used to delete all rows pemenently from a table.
sql>truncate table student;

delete:-
=====
It is used to delete all rows or particular row
To delete all rows
----------------------
SQL> delete from  student;

Diff  b/w delete and truncate:-
-----------------------------------
*Whenever we are using delete from <tablename>; or truncate table <tablename>; then delete records 
*In oracle Whenever we are using delete from <tablename>; then delete records "internally stored" in a buffer we can also get it back this buffer data into the
table by using "rollback" cmd.
*In oracle Whenever we are using truncate table <tablename>; and all rows are "permenently deleted" from table thats why "we cann't get it back" this deleted
rows by using rollback cmd also 

merge:-
=====
The MERGE statement was introduced in Oracle 9i to conditionally insert or update data depending on its presence, a process also known as an "upsert". 
The MERGE statement reduces table scans and can perform the operation in parallel if required.

select:-
1.select all columns and all rows.

2.select all coumns and particular rows(Where condition).
SQL> select * from student where sno=103;

3.select particular columns(col1, col2) and all rows.
SQL> select sname,phno from student;

4.select particular columns and particular rows.
SQL> select sname,phno from student where sno=101;
