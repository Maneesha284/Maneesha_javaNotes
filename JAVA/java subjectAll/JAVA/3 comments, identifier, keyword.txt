instanceof: Java instanceof keyword is used to check whether the object is an instance of the specified class or implements an interface.

native: Java native keyword is used to specify that a method is implemented in native code using JNI (Java Native Interface).

strictfp: Java strictfp is used to restrict the "floating-point calculations" to ensure portability.

this: Java this keyword can be used to refer the current object in a method or constructor.

throw: The Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception. The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exception. 
It is followed by an instance.

throws: The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. Checked exception can be propagated with throws.

transient: Java transient keyword is used in serialization. If you define any data variable as transient, it will not be serialized.

volatile: Java volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable may change asynchronously.

Comments:-
========
Def:-A "description" about a basic programming elements is called comments.
1.single line comment         //
2.multiline comment          /*       */
3.Document comment        /**      */

Example:-
//Addition.java                                                      //single line comment
/**This program shows adding  2 no.s               //Document comment
   *@version:1.8
   *@date:30-11-2019
   */
public class Addition
{
    /*This method takes two integer                //multiline comment
        numbers return result */
         void add(int a,int b)
         {
            return a+b;
         }
}

Identifier and rules:-
==============
Def:- Identifier is a name of the basic programming elements
class [Addition]                                                      //class name
{
   public static void [main](String[] [args])         //main,args
   {
       System.[out].[println]("hi");                         //out,println
    }
}

1.Identifier should only contains Alphabets(A to Z,a to z), Digits(0 to 9), special characters( _ or $)
2.Identifier should not start with  a digit
    1stStudent (No)
     Student1(Yes)
3.Identifier should not contain special characters the only  _ or $
      Student#abc (No)
      Student_abc(Yes)
4.Identifier should not contain space in the middle words.using with_connector symbol
    FirstProgram (Yes)
    First Program (No)
    First_Program (Yes)
5.Identifier is case sensitive (a!=A)
6.keywords can not be used as user defined identifier
    class static    (No)
     {
    }
Keywords:-
=======
Def:-keyword is a predefined identifier availavle directly JVM
Rulse:-
1.It can't be used as variable, method or class names
2.All characters must be lower case
*Class is not a keyword

In JAVA we have 50 keywords. 47 keywords introduced in 1.0v
In JAVA 1.2v new keyword "strictfp" was added
In JAVA 1.4v new keyword "assert" was added
In JAVA 5v new keyword "enum" was added

Among 50 keywords 2 keywords are reserved words can't be used in java program "const, goto"
