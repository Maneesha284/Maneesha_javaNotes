Java inner class:-
*Inner class or nested inner class which is declared inside the class or interface
Advtg:-
*Inner class can access all the data members and methods of outer class including private.
*Logically group of classes and interfaces in one place So It is develop more readable and maintainble(easy to understand relation b/w one class to other class)
*I requires less code write
*code optimization.

Non-static inner class:-
1.Member inner class:-A class is ctreated within class outside method
2.Anonymous inner class:-A class is created for implemetnts interface or extends class. This name name decided by jvm compiler
3.Local inner class:-A class is created within the method.
Static inner class:-
4.nested interface:-An interface created in class or interface.
5.Static inner class:- A static class is created inside class

1.Member inner class:-A class is ctreated within class outside method
=================================================
class TestMemberOuter1{  
 private int data=30;  
 class Inner{  
  void msg(){System.out.println("data is "+data);}  
 }  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  TestMemberOuter1 obj=new TestMemberOuter1();  
  TestMemberOuter1.Inner in=obj.new Inner();  
  in.msg();  
 }  
}  

2.Anonymous inner class:-A class is created for implemetnts interface or extends class. This name name decided by jvm compiler
=========================================================================================
interface Eatable{  
	 void eat();  
}  
class TestAnnonymousInner1{  
	 public static void main(String args[]){  
		 Eatable e=new Eatable(){  
  			public void eat(){
				System.out.println("nice fruits");
			}  
		 };  
	 e.eat();  
 	}  
}  
3.Local inner class:-A class is created within the method.
=======================================
public class localInner1{  
 	private int data=30;//instance variable  
 	void display(){  
 	 	class Local{  
   			void msg(){
				System.out.println(data);
			}  
	  	}  
 	 	Local l=new Local();  
 	 	l.msg();  
 	}  
 	public static void main(String args[]){  
 	 	localInner1 obj=new localInner1();  
  		obj.display();  
 	}  
}  

Static inner class:-
4.nested interface:-An interface created in class or interface.
==========================================
Syntax of nested interface which is declared within the interface
interface interface_name{  
 ...  
 interface nested_interface_name{  
  ...  
 }  
}   
Syntax of nested interface which is declared within the class
class class_name{  
 ...  
 interface nested_interface_name{  
  ...  
 }  
}   

5.Static inner class:- A static class is created inside class
=======================================
class TestOuter1{  
  static int data=30;  
  static class Inner{  
   void msg(){System.out.println("data is "+data);}  
  }  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  TestOuter1.Inner obj=new TestOuter1.Inner();  
  obj.msg();  
  }  
}
